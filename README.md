# Mobile App

The mobile Seneca App is used to collect data which in turn will be fed to the Seneca AI. 
Optionally other devices can be connected to the app. Currently I am working on a vibrating 
wrist band which replaces the audiovisual communication with the user by substituting speech
and GUI by haptic senses.

# The idea

This is the app you can use for your own discretion.
